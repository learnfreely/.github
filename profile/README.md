## Welcome to LearnFreely! :bulb:

Based in St. John's NL, LearnFreely is a local not-for-profit organization offering free tutoring to high school students for the majority of high school courses, including all STEM and most AP/IB courses. Our team is composed of university students who aim to develop academic skills by offering a semester-long mentorship. Our philosophy emphasizes long-term academic growth by helping students with their most demanding course and teaching re-applicable study habits that should independently be applied to their other courses and in further post-secondary studies. We are very excited to serve our local community and prepare students for their future academic endeavors.
